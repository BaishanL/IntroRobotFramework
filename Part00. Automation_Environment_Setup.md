# Part00. Automation Environment Setup

Most current automation test cases are written in Robot Framework and python.

Before running your first automation script, please set up your desktop following the instruction (take windows for example)

## OS:
Most of software needed are cross-platform compatible.   
Windows is preferable for workstation,   
Macbook is great for client,   
and servers are running Linux (Ubuntu).  

## For my setup:
- desktop: windows 10. 
- client: macbook/mac mini
- Servers: Ubuntu 20. 

## Softwares:  
- latest python3
- latest robot framework 
- git client
- IDE: Pycharm or VSCode

## install libraries for robot framework as needed

```
